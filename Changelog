	dynamicHybrid: When number of merges below the cut is smaller than minClusterSize, simply return
	with all labels=0 instead of throwing an error.

	change default cutHeight from max(dendro$height) to 99% of the range
	of between maximum and 5th percentile (from minimum) of dendro$height

	change in printFlush: use cat, not print to get rid of the [1] " leading the output
